# FreeFoodVTFinder

Welcome to VT Food finder, we are an app that allows students to find free food on campus. As we know paying for food all the time can be annoying, and as a college students who doesn't like free stuff. Well now
it should be easy! Just put in your vaild vt email and browse through the collection of the free foods that are currently present not just today but also upcoming. 

Currently I am working with four other classmates to develop a React app that uses python scripting to scrap through the gobberconnect website and locate the free food. The app displays the locations, time, date 
of where the food is. Along with urls/descriptions of what the event is for users. As of now we are currently trying to implement an on screen navigiation feature using the GeoApify to gives students easier 
access to locate the buildings where thse events are.
