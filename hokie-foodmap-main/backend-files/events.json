These dynamics can be especially isolating for graduate students, who frequently navigate unclear boundaries and power imbalances.\nOne way we hope to frame this discussion is by normalizing the conversation around academic bullying—recognizing that part of the problem is how inaccessible or uncomfortable the topic can feel. When we struggle to name these behaviors, we risk allowing them to continue unchecked.\nIn this event, we will explore the structural and cultural forces that allow academic bullying to persist and consider how graduate students, faculty, and institutions can work together to challenge them. While barriers to change are real, we believe in the power of collective effort to promote healthier, more equitable academic spaces.\nJoin us to name the problem—and imagine the solutions.",
